= Overview

Termed API is service for storing data in graph structure.


[[resources-graphs]]
== Graphs

A Graph contains Types and Nodes. Termed instance typically contains many graphs. Graph is analog to
database or schema in RDBMS. Types define fields for Nodes. Nodes contain the actual data. Graphs
themselves contain `properties` (multimap of localized text values), list of `roles` and map of
`permissions`. Only users with application role `ADMIN` or `SUPERUSER` can create new graphs.

[[resources-types]]
== Types

Write operations on Type API are typically used only before data (i.e. Nodes) are loaded the first
time. After that, Types are mostly just read. Types can be expanded on the fly (i.e. new attributes
can be added). However, removing an attribute might not be possible if there are still values in
the nodes with the given attribute.

[[resources-nodes]]
== Nodes (CRUD API)

Applications typically operate mostly on Node API. There are two main APIs for nodes. CRUD API and
Tree API. The former is simple create-read-update-delete API for nodes. The latter is read-only
API that supports complex queries and tree serializations.

[[resources-node-trees]]
== Node Trees

=== Node Tree Query Language

Node Tree API supports complex `select` and `where` parameters to limit and format requested nodes.
Also `sort` and `max` parameters are supported.

==== Select clause

Select clauses define what fields are select.

To select all fields, use `select=*`.

Simple select is done for example using `select=id,type,uri,lastModifiedBy`.

Properties are selected by `select=properties.prefLabel`. All properties can be selected by
`select=properties.*`. Selected properties can be qualified by type. E.g.
`select=Person.properties.name` would only select name in Person type. Finally, shorthand `p` for
`properties` can be used, e.g. `select=p.name`.

References are selected by `select=references.broader`. All references can be selected by
`select=references.*`. Selecting can be recursive so that referred values' fields will be
recursively expanded. Recursive select is done by giving max recursion depth after selected attribute
e.g. `select=references.broader:2`. Selects can also be qualified by type:
`select=Concept.references.broader`. Finally, shorthand `r` for `references` can be used,
e.g. `select=r.broader`.

Referrers select work similarly to references select.

==== Where clause

Where queries are modelled after Lucene queries.

Properties can be queried by many different ways. Simple property match is done by
`where=properties.name:John`. Value part after the colon must not contain whitespace.
Phrase is matched by `where=properties.name:"John Smith"`. Prefix search can be done with
`\*` symbol, e.g. `where=properties.name:Jo*`. Localized field is matched with
`where=properties.prefLabel.en:Cat`. Shorthand `p.` can be used for `properties.`.

Property fields `properties.<attr-id>` contain tokenized values. If un-tokenized fields are needed
for exact matching use `properties.<attr-id>.string`.

Un-tokenized properties can be queried similarly to tokenized (e.g. `properties.name.string:"John Smith"`).
Difference is that `properties.name:"John Smith"` would also match names such as "George John Smith".
Un-tokenized field can also be used in range queries such as `properties.publishDate.string:[* TO 2019-08-01]`
if field `publishDate` contains ISO-formatted dates.

Boolean queries are also supported. Supported operators are `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` with `(` and `)`
for grouping. E.g. `where=(properties.name:John OR properties.name:Lisa) AND NOT properties.name:Jack`.
Exactly one space should be used as whitespace.

Query (or part of it) can be boosted with `properties.name:John^2`. This means that boosted field
is weighted more in the query.

References are queried with `references.<attr-id>.id:<uuid>`. For example
`references.knows.id:02ae45a7-df3b-4433-8d59-6c83ee20c46b`. Nodes that do not refer anything
via some reference can be found with e.g. `references.knows.id:null`. Path based querying is also
possible but it should be noted that it can be very inefficient. Path based queries are done
like `references.knows.references.knows.id:<uuid>` or `references.broader.uri:<uri>` or
`references.broader.properties.prefLabel:Animal`. Shorthand `r.` can be used for `references.`.

Referrers are not supported in queries.

==== Sort clause

Select clauses define what fields are select. By default, sort is relevance based. Common
requirement is to sort by some property value. Sorting by for example `prefLabel` in `en` locale
would be done by `sort=properties.prefLabel.en`. Descending sort can be requested using `+desc`
suffix (e.g. `sort=properties.prefLabel.en+desc`).

==== Max clause

Max parameter limits the number of results returned. Default value is typically `25` or `50`. Special
value `-1` returns all results.

[[resources-users]]
== Users

User API operations are permitted only for superusers.

=== Delete a User

include::{snippets}/delete-a-user/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::delete-a-user[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request']

[[resources-admin-operations]]
== Admin operations

Following administrative API operations are permitted only for superusers.

=== Reindex

Full index on nodes is kept on disk. If index is corrupted, indexing format is updated etc. full
re-indexing may be required.

include::{snippets}/delete-index/operation-intro.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/delete-graph-index/operation-intro.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/delete-type-index/operation-intro.adoc[]

=== Invalidate caches

Most database read operations excluding node API involve simple LRU-cache. If e.g. type, graph or
user definitions are edited directly from underlying relational database, cache invalidation
may be required. Operation is typically very fast.

include::{snippets}/delete-caches/operation-intro.adoc[]

=== Purge revision history

Node revisions are automatically created on each node modification. Purging revision history cleans
all entries from history tables. Operation may take several minutes to complete.

=== Revert graph nodes to past revision
