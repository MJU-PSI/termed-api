= Overview

Termed API is service for storing data in graph structure.


[[resources-graphs]]
== Graphs

A Graph contains Types and Nodes. Termed instance typically contains many graphs. Graph is analog to
database or schema in RDBMS. Types define fields for Nodes. Nodes contain the actual data. Graphs
themselves contain `properties` (multimap of localized text values), list of `roles` and map of
`permissions`. Only users with application role `ADMIN` or `SUPERUSER` can create new graphs.

[[resources-types]]
== Types

Write operations on Type API are typically used only before data (i.e. Nodes) are loaded the first
time. After that, Types are mostly just read. Types can be expanded on the fly (i.e. new attributes
can be added). However, removing an attribute might not be possible if there are still values in
the nodes with the given attribute.

[[resources-nodes]]
== Nodes (CRUD API)

Applications typically operate mostly on Node API. There are two main APIs for nodes. CRUD API and
Tree API. The former is simple create-read-update-delete API for nodes. The latter is read-only
API that supports complex queries and tree serializations.

[[resources-node-trees]]
== Node Trees

Node Tree API supports `select`, `where`, `sort` and `max` parameters to narrow and sort requested
nodes: `GET /api/node-trees?select=<fields>&where=<criteria>&sort=<fields>&max=<number>`.

Typically queries are limited to some graph or type or single tree with:
....
GET /api/graphs/{graphId}/node-trees
GET /api/graphs/{graphId}/types/{typeId}/node-trees
GET /api/graphs/{graphId}/types/{typeId}/node-trees/{id}
....

=== Node Tree Query Language

Node Tree Query Language specifies the syntax of `select`, `where`, `sort` and `max` parameters.

==== Select

Select controls fields that are returned on result objects.

.Syntax for select
----
select               = "" | "*" | field-names


field-names          = field-name | field-names "," field-name
field-name           = "id" | "type" | "number" | "code" | "uri"
                     | "createdBy" | "createdDate"
                     | "lastModifiedBy" | "lastModifiedDate"
                     | q-prop-field-w-depth
                     | q-ref-field-w-depth
                     | q-refr-field-w-depth


q-prop-field-w-depth = q-prop-field ":" max-depth
                     | q-prop-field
q-prop-field         = graph-id "." type-id "." prop-field
                     | type-id "." prop-field
                     | prop-field
prop-field           = ("p." | "props." | "properties.") ("*" | text-attribute-id)


q-ref-field-w-depth  = q-ref-field ":" max-depth
                     | q-ref-field
q-ref-field          = graph-id "." type-id "." ref-field
                     | type-id "." ref-field
                     | ref-field
ref-field            = ("r." | "refs." | "references.") ("*" | reference-attribute-id)


q-refr-field-w-depth = q-refr-field ":" max-depth
                     | q-refr-field
q-refr-field         = graph-id "." type-id "." refr-field
                     | type-id "." refr-field
                     | refr-field
refr-field           = ("refrs." | "referrers.") ("*" | reference-attribute-id)
----

To select all fields, use `select=*`.

Simple select is done for example using `select=id,type,uri,lastModifiedBy`.

Properties are selected by `select=properties.prefLabel`. All properties can be selected by
`select=properties.*`. Selected properties can be qualified by type. E.g.
`select=Person.properties.name` would only select name in Person type. Finally, shorthand `p` for
`properties` can be used, e.g. `select=p.name`.

References are selected by `select=references.broader`. All references can be selected by
`select=references.*`. Selecting can be recursive so that referred values' fields will be
recursively expanded. Recursive select is done by giving max recursion depth after selected attribute
e.g. `select=references.broader:2`. Selects can also be qualified by type:
`select=Concept.references.broader`. Finally, shorthand `r` for `references` can be used,
e.g. `select=r.broader`.

Referrers select work similarly to references select.

==== Where

Where queries are modelled after Lucene queries.

.Syntax for where
----
where             = "" | boolean-query

boolean-query     = term " OR " term | term
term              = factor " AND " factor | factor
factor            = "NOT " factor | node-query | (" boolean-query ")" | factor "^" boost

node-query        = node-id-query
                  | node-prop-query
                  | node-ref-query

node-id-query     = ("id" | "node.id" | "nodeId" | "urn:uuid") ":" uuid
                  | "code:" code
                  | "uri:" uri
                  | ("number" | "n") ":" integer
                  | "createdDate:[" (iso-date | "*") " TO " (iso-date | "*") "]"
                  | "lastModifiedDate:[" (iso-date | "*") " TO " (iso-date | "*") "]"
                  | ("type.graph.id" | "graph.id" | "graphId") ":" uuid
                  | ("type.graph.code" | "graph.code" | "graphCode") ":" code
                  | ("type.graph.uri" | "graph.uri" | "graphUri") ":" uri
                  | ("type.code" | "typeCode") ":" code
                  | ("type.uri" | "typeUri") ":" uri

node-prop-query   = prop-lang-str-key ":\"" string "\""
                  | prop-lang-key ".string:[" (string | "*") " TO " (string | "*") ")"
                  | prop-lang-str-key ":" string "*"
                  | prop-lang-str-key ":" string

prop-lang-str-key = prop-lang-key ".string" | prop-lang-key
prop-lang-key     = prop-key "." lang-code | prop-key
prop-key          = ("properties" | "props" | "p") "." text-attr-id

node-ref-query    = ref-key ".id:" uuid
                  | ref-key ".id:null"
                  | ref-key ":" node-query

ref-key           = ("references" | "refs" | "r") "." reference-attr-id
----

Properties can be queried by many different ways. Simple property match is done by
`where=properties.name:John`. Value part after the colon must not contain whitespace.
Phrase is matched by `where=properties.name:"John Smith"`. Prefix search can be done with
`\*` symbol, e.g. `where=properties.name:Jo*`. Localized field is matched with
`where=properties.prefLabel.en:Cat`. Shorthand `p.` can be used for `properties.`.

Property fields `properties.<attr-id>` contain tokenized values. If un-tokenized fields are needed
for exact matching use `properties.<attr-id>.string`.

Un-tokenized properties can be queried similarly to tokenized (e.g. `properties.name.string:"John Smith"`).
Difference is that `properties.name:"John Smith"` would also match names such as "George John Smith".
Un-tokenized field can also be used in range queries such as `properties.publishDate.string:[* TO 2019-08-01]`
if field `publishDate` contains ISO-formatted dates.

Boolean queries are also supported. Supported operators are `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` with `(` and `)`
for grouping. E.g. `where=(properties.name:John OR properties.name:Lisa) AND NOT properties.name:Jack`.
Exactly one space should be used as whitespace.

Query (or part of it) can be boosted with `properties.name:John^2`. This means that boosted field
is weighted more in the query.

References are queried with `references.<attr-id>.id:<uuid>`. For example
`references.knows.id:02ae45a7-df3b-4433-8d59-6c83ee20c46b`. Nodes that do not refer anything
via some reference can be found with e.g. `references.knows.id:null`. Path based querying is also
possible but it should be noted that it can be very inefficient. Path based queries are done
like `references.knows.references.knows.id:<uuid>` or `references.broader.uri:<uri>` or
`references.broader.properties.prefLabel:Animal`. Shorthand `r.` can be used for `references.`.

Referrers are not supported in queries.

==== Sort

Sort lists what fields are used to sort result list. By default, sort is relevance based. Sorting by
for example `prefLabel` with `en` language would be done by `sort=properties.prefLabel.en`.
Descending sort can be used with `+desc` suffix (e.g. `sort=properties.prefLabel.en+desc`).

==== Max

Max parameter limits the number of results returned. Default value is typically `25` or `50`. Special
value `-1` returns all results.

If only counts are needed `/api/node-count?where=<criteria>` can be used. Supported API for
counting is very similar to Node Tree API except it returns integers. API can be used as follows:

....
GET /api/node-count?where=<criteria>
GET /api/graphs/{graphId}/node-count?where=<criteria>
GET /api/graphs/{graphId}/types/{typeId}/node-count?where=<criteria>
....

If where criteria is not provided or is empty, full node count is returned.

user definitions are edited directly from underlying relational database, cache invalidation
may be required. Operation is typically very fast.
