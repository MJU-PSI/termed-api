[[overview]]
= Overview

Termed API is service for storing data in graph structure.


[[resources-graphs]]
== Graphs

=== Get a Graph

include::{snippets}/get-a-graph/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-a-graph[snippets='path-parameters,response-fields,curl-request,response-body']

=== Get all Graphs

include::{snippets}/get-all-graphs/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-all-graphs[snippets='curl-request,response-body']

=== Save a Graph

include::{snippets}/save-a-graph/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::save-a-graph[snippets='request-parameters,request-fields,curl-request']

==== Saving using PUT

include::{snippets}/save-a-graph-using-put/operation-intro.adoc[]

=== Delete a Graph

include::{snippets}/delete-a-graph/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::delete-a-graph[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request']


[[resources-types]]
== Types

Write operations on Type API are typically used only before data (i.e. Nodes) are loaded the first
time. After that, Types are mostly just read. Types can be expanded on the fly (i.e. new attributes
can be added). However, removing an attribute might not be possible if there are still values in
the nodes with the given attribute.

=== Get a Type

include::{snippets}/get-a-type/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-a-type[snippets='path-parameters,response-fields']

where each value in `textAttributes` contains

include::{snippets}/get-a-type-text-attribute/response-fields.adoc[]

and each value in `referenceAttributes` contains

include::{snippets}/get-a-type-reference-attribute/response-fields.adoc[]

operation::get-a-type[snippets='curl-request,response-body']

=== Get Types in Graph

include::{snippets}/get-graph-types/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-all-types[snippets='curl-request']

=== Get all Types

include::{snippets}/get-all-types/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-all-types[snippets='curl-request']

=== Save a Type

include::{snippets}/save-a-type/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::save-a-type[snippets='path-parameters,request-parameters,request-fields']

where each value in `textAttributes` contains

include::{snippets}/save-a-type-text-attribute/request-fields.adoc[]

and each value in `referenceAttributes` contains

include::{snippets}/save-a-type-reference-attribute/request-fields.adoc[]

operation::save-a-type[snippets='curl-request']

==== Saving using PUT

include::{snippets}/save-a-type-using-put/operation-intro.adoc[]

=== Delete a Type

include::{snippets}/delete-a-type/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::delete-a-type[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request']


[[resources-nodes]]
== Nodes (CRUD API)

Applications typically operate mostly on Node API. There are two main APIs for nodes. CRUD API and
Tree API. The former is simple create-read-update-delete API for nodes. The latter is read-only
API that supports complex queries and tree serializations.

=== Get a Node

include::{snippets}/get-a-node/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-a-node[snippets='path-parameters,response-fields,curl-request,response-body']

=== Get Nodes of Type

include::{snippets}/get-type-nodes/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-type-nodes[snippets='curl-request']

=== Get Nodes in Graph

include::{snippets}/get-graph-nodes/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-graph-nodes[snippets='curl-request']

=== Get all Nodes

include::{snippets}/get-all-nodes/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-all-node[snippets='curl-request']

=== Save a Node

include::{snippets}/save-a-node/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::save-a-node[snippets='path-parameters,request-parameters,request-fields,curl-request']

==== Saving using PUT

include::{snippets}/save-a-node-using-put/operation-intro.adoc[]

=== Delete a Node

include::{snippets}/delete-a-node/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::delete-a-node[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request']


[[resources-users]]
== Users

User API operations are permitted only for superusers.

=== Get a User

include::{snippets}/get-a-user/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-a-user[snippets='path-parameters,response-fields,curl-request,response-body']

=== Get all Users

include::{snippets}/get-all-users/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::get-all-users[snippets='curl-request']

=== Save a User

include::{snippets}/save-a-user/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::save-a-user[snippets='request-parameters,request-fields,curl-request']

=== Delete a User

include::{snippets}/delete-a-user/operation-intro.adoc[]

operation::delete-a-user[snippets='path-parameters,curl-request']

[[resources-admin-operations]]
== Admin operations

Following administrative API operations are permitted only for superusers.

=== Reindex

Full index on nodes is kept on disk. If index is corrupted, indexing format is updated etc. full
re-indexing may be required.

include::{snippets}/delete-index/operation-intro.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/delete-graph-index/operation-intro.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/delete-type-index/operation-intro.adoc[]

=== Invalidate caches

Most database read operations excluding node API involve simple LRU-cache. If e.g. type, graph or
user definitions are edited directly from underlying relational database, cache invalidation
may be required. Operation is typically very fast.

include::{snippets}/delete-caches/operation-intro.adoc[]

=== Purge revision history

Node revisions are automatically created on each node modification. Purging revision history cleans
all entries from history tables. Operation may take several minutes to complete.
